    <h2>what is coronavirus</h2>
    <p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease
         caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. <br>

Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience
 mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without 
 requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with 
 underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes,
  chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop 
  serious illness. <br>
  The best way to prevent and slow down transmission 
  is to be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, 
  the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect 
  yourself and others from infection by washing your 
  hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not 
  touching your face. <br>
  The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva 
  or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, 
  so itâ€™s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette 
  (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).

    </p>

   <h2>What would you do</h3>
   <ul><strong>Some advises to those who have already recovered from covid-19</strong></ul>
   <li>Follow good cough etiquette and good hand hygiene.</li>
   <li>You and your closest circle can be together as normal. 
       You can decide who is in your closest circle, but they 
       should not be too many and they should be the same people 
       over time.</li>
       <li>Keep an increased distance from others than your closest circle.</li>
       <li>Avoid physical contact, including shaking hands and hugging</li>
       <li>If you have, or get respiratory tract symptoms you should stay at 
           home until the symptoms have passed. Children of primary school/child 
           care age who only have a runny nose and are in general in good health,
            without other symptoms of newly formed respiratory tract infection, 
            do not need to stay at home</li>
